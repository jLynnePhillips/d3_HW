    <h2>From 2014 data</h2>
    <iframe width="960" height="510" src="d3.html"></iframe>
    <p>This graph plots the percentage of people in each state that live below poverty vs the percentage of people in each state that have not visited a dentist or dental clinic in the past year for any reason. The percentage of people that live below poverty was estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey and the percentage of people that have not had a dental health visit within the last year was estimated by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Both percentages were from 2014 data.</p>
